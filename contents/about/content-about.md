Background
----------

The Singapore Government Design System (SGDS) was developed to empower teams in creating fast, accessible and mobile-friendly digital services, with a common set of UI components that comply with the [Digital Service Standards](https://www.tech.gov.sg/digital-service-standards/). As the web constantly evolves, the Government must match evolving user expectations to deliver high-quality digital services.

### Where to use SGDS

#### Static Informational Websites

A static site is the most basic website, and the easiest to build. It requires no server-side processing, serving only client-side content in the form of HTML pages (and optionally CSS and JavaScript) to users' browsers or mobile phones.
