Background
----------

The Singapore Government Design System (SGDS) was developed to empower teams in creating fast, accessible and mobile-friendly digital services, with a common set of UI components that comply with the [Digital Service Standards](https://www.tech.gov.sg/digital-service-standards/). As the web constantly evolves, the Government must match evolving user expectations to deliver high-quality digital services.

### Where to use SGDS

#### Static Informational Websites

A static site is the most basic website, and the easiest to build. It requires no server-side processing, serving only client-side content in the form of HTML pages (and optionally CSS and JavaScript) to users' browsers or mobile phones.

**[Isomer](https://www.isomer.gov.sg/)** is an informational website generator created by the Government Technology Agency of Singapore (GovTech). It provides templates for websites based on SGDS, allows users to easily edit website content, provides hosting and is compliant to applicable clauses in the Instruction Manual 8 (IM8), Design Service Standard (DSS) and Usability Checklist (UC).

#### Dynamic Informational Websites

Similar to static sites, dynamic websites serve client-side content. The difference, however, is that it uses a server and database to generate such client-side content on the fly, before serving them to user devices.

For example, WordPress sites commonly make use of PHP programs together with MySQL as a database to serve dynamically-generated content to users. They also support user logins for content writers. For this reason, dynamic websites tend to be more complicated and costly to build.

**[Content Website Platform(CWP)](https://www.xtremax.com/discover-cwp)** is a common secured website building and serving platform. It provides a suite of standardised software for hosting content-based websites. It enables unclassified government websites to be centrally managed and operated in the public cloud.

#### Transactional Websites

A transactional website is a full-scale website that allows users to perform transactions, for example online banking or retail purchases. Government transactional sites typically allow users to interact with government services digitally, such as HDB or CPF.

Transactional sites are usually built by vendors, who are encouraged to leverage on SGDS to deliver the best user experience.
